LBL_WKID_IN=Input WKID
DESC_WKID_IN=Well-known id of the input geopmetry's coordinate system
LBL_WKID_BUFFER=Buffer WKID
DESC_WKID_BUFFER=Well-known id of a projected coordinate used to measure the buffer (must be projected)

LBL_TIMESTAMP_FIELD=Time-stamp field
DESC_TIMESTAMP_FIELD=GeoEvent field used to derive timestamp
LBL_TIMESTAMP_TOKEN=Time-stamp Token
DESC_TIMESTAMP_TOKEN=Time-stamp token generated by the processor.
LBL_HOST=Host
DESC_HOST=GeoEvent server host
LBL_GEO_DEF_NAME=Output GeoEvent Definition
DESC_GEO_DEF_NAME=Name of the GeoEvent definition created by the processor
LBL_CONNECTION=ArcGIS Server Connection
DESC_CONNECTION=Connection to ArcGIS Server hosting the service that will be queried
