# Query Report Processor

Query Report Processor - Executes a spatial query on feature services registered in GeoEvent Processor's data store.  The author of the service can then configures a report based on returned features.

## Requirements

* See common [solutions-geoevent-java requirements](../../../../README.md#requirements).
* The ArcGIS Runtime for Java SDK is required in order to run the standalone Maven Tests included with this project.

## Building 

* See the [solutions-geoevent-java instructions](../../../../README.md#instructions) for general instructions on 
    * verifying your Maven installation
    * setting the location of GeoEvent Processor and GeoEvent Processor SDK repositories
    * and any other common required steps
* Open a command prompt and navigate to `solutions-geoevent-java/solutions-geoevent/processors/10.3.0/query-report-processor`
    * Enter `mvn install` at the prompt.

## Installation

* Install the Geometry Processors.
    * Browse to `solutions-geoevent-java/geoevent-solutions/processors/10.3.0/query-report-processor/target` (this directory is created when you execute mvn install).
    * Copy the .jar file and paste it into the deploy folder in the GeoEvent Processor install directory ([GeoEvent Processor install location]\deploy\ -- default location is C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Server\GeoEventProcessor\deploy).

## Testing

### Validating the Installation
 
* See the [solutions-geoevent-java validation instructions](../../../README.md#validating-install).
    * Ensure the Query Report Processor exists.

### Testing with Simulated Test Data

#### Deploying the Test Configuration

If you have already deployed the test configuration you may move on to Testing the Component

In GeoEvent Extension Manager 

* Go to the Site >> Configuration Store Tab. 
* Click the 'Import Configuration' button. 
* Select 'Choose File'
* Browse to the ./solutions-geoevent-java/data/configurations/ directory 
* Select the SolutionsComponentTestConfig.xml 
* Click 'Open' in the dialog. 
* Click 'Next'. 
* When prompted choose 'Import Configuration'. 

The test service configuration will be deployed to your instance of GeoEvent.

#### Testing the Component

The Introduction to GeoEvent tutorial has a simple TCP-Console application that will be used for most of the tests. It can be found [here](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=b6a35042effd44ceab3976941d36efcf).

#### Configuring the Query Report Processor

Use the following illustration as a guide to the configurable properties supported in the Query Report Processor

![Image Properties](doc/properties.png)

 The Query Report Processor uses tokens as place holders that are replaced with feature data extracted from the query response, values from the geoevent, a timesamp optionally generated by the processor and/or a distance calculated between the event geometry and each returned feature. Use the following illustration as a guide to the supported format of tokens.

You will use the QueryReport-Test service from the Solutions Test Configuration to test the functionality of the Query Report Processor.
* This simulation requires the refugee_camps service be published to your default datastore. Make adjustments as needed to query another service or if the refugee_cams service is published to a different ArcGIS Server instance. A map package containing the layers for this service can be found [here](../../../../../blob/master/data/packages/refugee_camps.mpk?raw=true)
* Open the QueryReport-Test service in GEE Manager. 
* Click on the query-report-tcp-txt-in Input and expand the 'Advanced' tab. Note that the input uses TCP port 5605.
* Open the ArcGIS GeoEvent Simulator (this is installed with GeoEvent Extension and can be found at the GeoEvent Extension install location).
* Make sure the Server points to the server on which GeoEvent Extension is deployed (default is local host).
* In the upper right, change the port to 5605 and  click the button with the red X to connect (Note: if you cannot connect the server is not listening on that port. This may be because the Input in GeoEvent extension has not been started).
* Make sure 'File' is selected in the combo box on the upper left.
* Click the 'Load File' button in the upper right.
* In the new dialog, click the file folder button in the upper right.
* Browse to the ./solutions-geoevent-java/data/simulation-files/ directory.
* Select queryreport.csv and click 'Open' (note the same simulation file is used for both query report processoer and spatial query processor).
* Click the 'Load' button. In the Preview Edits window you will see 1 record.
* Browse to the directory of the TCP-Console application (if you downloaded it from the tutorial it will be at ./IntroductionToGeoEvent/utilities/tcp-server-app).
* Double click TCPServerApp.bat (the application will not start if no services are listening on port 5570 - if you have deployed the test configuration an output service has been configured to listen on this port. Check that the Output tcp-out-5570 has been deployed and started).
* In the GeoEvent Simulator click the 'Step' button.
* In the TCP-console you will see that the Received Event (Event Definition name) is QueryReportTest with a comma separated list of values. A url will be one of the attributes. This url represents the location of the generated report. Browse to this location to see a configured report.
